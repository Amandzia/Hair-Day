                <p>Pria, the owner of Hair Day, earned her certificate as a colorist and immediately started
                    specializing in edgy, custom coloring techniques. She wanted to create a "treat yourself"
                    environment for her clients. Pria opened the salon with her good friend and talented hairdresser,
                    Garry. They have a staff of seven: two stylists, three colorists, one manicurist and one make-up
                    artist.</p>
